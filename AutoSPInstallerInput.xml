<!-- AutoSPInstaller Sample Configuration File
    General Instructions:
    1. If you use the characters ' " < > & in your configuration (e.g. in passwords) you should encode them as follows:

        '	&apos;
        "	&quot;
        <	&lt;
        >	&gt;
        &	&amp;
    
        For example <Password>Fd"je&f</Password> should be written <Password>Fd&quot;je&amp;f</Password>
    2. Configuration IS case sensitive.
    3. Use a validator like http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp to check the syntax of your file.
    4. Any element that has a Provision="" attribute controls whether a particular component, site, or service is installed
       on a particular server. It can be set to either true to provision on every server on which the script is run,
       false to never provision, or to a list of computer names to provision the service only on the listed machines.
       This allows you to configure an entire multi-server farm with different servers fulfilling different roles
       using a single configuration file.
       e.g. <ExcelServices Provision="Server1 Server2"> would provision excel services only on Server1 and Server2. -->
<!-- The Environment attribute below appears at the top of the installation transcript. It does not affect the installation -->
<Configuration Environment="Dev" Version="3.5">
    <!-- The Install section controls what modifications are made to the Windows OS prior to installation and how the SharePoint installation is run.
         You can also explicitly state the SPVersion of SharePoint being installed, (in case you have binaries for both SP2010/SP2013 in your folder structure).
         Allowed values are "2010" or "2013". If you omit this, the script will attempt to determine the version anyhow, and default to 2013 if both sets of install files are present. -->
